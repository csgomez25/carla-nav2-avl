# A camera that refuses to open always prints the same thing from the ZED SDK
# ("CAMERA STREAM FAILED TO START"), whatever the cause. The cause is only
# visible in nvargus-daemon's log. This reads both and names the case.
#
#   ./camera_doctor.sh          diagnose
#   ./camera_doctor.sh --stop   stop every camera client GRACEFULLY, then diagnose
#
# Cases, cheapest fix first (all four were hit on the car 2026-09-15/16):
#
#   HELD        another process has the camera (one client per ZED X).
#               -> stop that process. No restart helps while it holds it.
#   LINK        link dropping mid-stream ("CAMERA REBOOTING", "Connection
#               issue"). Usually a marginal GMSL connector, worse with
#               vibration outdoors.  -> reseat the cable.
#   GL          a camera opened while something held the display's GL context
#               ("BadParameter ... createBuffer", container exit -11).
#               -> start RViz AFTER the cameras, never before.
#   WEDGED      Argus itself is unhappy ("Cannot create camera provider",
#               "NvPclOpen: PCL Open Failed", "NOT DETECTED" with the serial
#               present in dmesg).  -> reboot. Do NOT restart nvargus-daemon
#               or zed_x_daemon: on 2026-09-16 that turned a recoverable
#               state into a crash loop on all three cameras.
