# Lean perception stack — quick reference

One launch that starts **only what perception needs**: sensors, the cameras you
ask for with lean ZED settings, and the costmap node. Measured on dinosaur
2026-09-16: camera drivers **80% → 49% of a core (−39%)**, RAM **−371 MB**,
costmap steady at 10 Hz.

## Run it

```bash
conda deactivate                     # the dinosaur account auto-activates conda
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source ~/IGVC/install/setup.bash
source <this workspace>/install/setup.bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0 RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp AVL_MODELS_DIR=/home/dinosaur/models
export CYCLONEDDS_URI=file://$HOME/IGVC/install/avros_bringup/share/avros_bringup/config/cyclonedds.xml

# stop the boot stack first -- it owns the cameras
sudo systemctl stop percept-stack
tmux -L percept kill-session -t percept 2>/dev/null; pkill -x rviz2; sleep 5

ros2 launch perception_costmap perception_stack.launch.py            # 3 cameras + costmap
ros2 launch perception_costmap perception_stack.launch.py rviz:=true # + colorizer + RViz
```

Cameras start staggered (15 s / 55 s / 95 s) — parallel starts wedge GMSL.
Restore the normal stack with `sudo systemctl start percept-stack`.

### Arguments worth knowing

| arg | default | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `cameras` | `front,left,right` | which cameras; `none` for sensors + costmap only |
| `config` | `perception_dinosaur.yaml` | perception params |
| `rviz` | `false` | colorized costmap view, started **after** the cameras |
| `viz` | `auto` | `costmap_rgb_node` only; `auto` = on when `rviz:=true` |
| `lidar` | `true` | Velodyne. Without the EKF it logs `"odom" does not exist`; perception doesn't use it |
| `sensors` | `true` | URDF/TF, Velodyne, Xsens |
| `costmap_rate` | *(config)* | override `publish_rate` (Hz). Keep >= the fastest camera's rate or frames go unprocessed. Measured: 10->5 Hz saves only 0.19 core, see `logs/results/2026-09-17_costmap-rate-sweep.md` |
| `reuse_running` | `true` | skip anything already running instead of starting a second copy |

`--show-args` lists the rest (serials, delays, `ros_domain_id`).

## What we changed

- **`config/zed_perception_{front,left,right}.yaml`** — cameras publish only RGB,
  depth and confidence. No point cloud, no positional tracking, no IMU;
  processing capped at 8 fps. Those were tuned for the old kiwicampus Nav2
  layer, which nothing reads any more.
- **`launch/perception_stack.launch.py`** — the launch above. Reuses anything
  already running (ROS graph + local processes), so two people can't start the
  same camera twice.
- **`deploy/perception_lean.rviz`** — costmap as flat squares in `base_link`,
  no RobotModel, no camera panels.
- **`/perception/reset` + `deploy/fresh_run.sh`** — clear a run's accumulated
  obstacles without restarting the stack.
- **Fixes:** C1 grid-edge truncation, C3 Nav2 16 m clearing range, C4
  road-keeping (bridge now reads the node's `offroad_cost` instead of guessing),
  C5 homography scale, C6 depth wait on cameras without depth, C7 detector
  results surviving a reset. Details in `ISSUES.md`.

## Cameras won't open? Ask the doctor

```bash
deploy/camera_doctor.sh          # name the failure and the fix
deploy/camera_doctor.sh --stop   # stop every camera client gracefully first
```

It reads nvargus-daemon and the wrapper logs and says which of four cases you
have: **HELD** (another process owns the camera), **LINK** (GMSL dropping
mid-stream -> reseat the cable), **GL** (a camera opened while something held
the display's GL context -> start RViz after the cameras), or **WEDGED**
(reboot; do *not* restart the camera daemons).

Always stop cameras with `--stop` (SIGINT, wait) rather than
`tmux kill-session` or `pkill -9`: a hard kill leaves Argus holding streams
the next open then trips over.

## Gotchas that cost us time

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `CAMERA STREAM FAILED TO START`, `AlreadyAllocated ... in use` | another program holds that ZED | stop it; one client per camera |
| `Cannot create camera provider` / `NOT DETECTED` | camera daemon not answering | reboot; **don't** restart nvargus/zed_x_daemon, that made it worse |
| `(Argus) BadParameter ... createBuffer`, container exit `-11` | a camera opened while RViz held the display's GL context | start RViz **after** the cameras |
| rviz2 "failed to create drawable" then segfault | config with a RobotModel (`zedx.stl` isn't installed), or a second rviz2 on the same display | use `perception_lean.rviz`; `pkill -x rviz2` first |
| RViz opens but the costmap panel is empty | that view draws `/viz/costmap_rgb`; `costmap_rgb_node` isn't running, or the display is unticked | `viz:=true`, and check the display's checkbox |
| `ros2` finds nothing / pytest missing | conda `(base)` is active | `conda deactivate` |

Don't point RViz's Map display at `/perception/costmap`: `unknown_cost` is 25,
so blind cells render as ordinary low cost — blind spots look drivable.
`costmap_rgb_node` uses `/perception/known` to tell them apart.

## Still open

Full entries in `ISSUES.md`; this is the short list with effort and where it
shows up.

| # | what | effort | why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| P6 | the Nav2 bridge flattens the graded costmap to a binary ring | 1 h (config) / 1 day (plugin) | **the headline for path quality** — Nav2 never sees the ramp or the per-class halos, only cells >= 97, re-inflated with its own radius |
| P7 | temporal filter has one threshold, no hysteresis | hours, offline | intermittently-seen cells sit on the threshold and toggle; every crossing adds/removes a lethal cell plus its halo, and the planner twitches |
| P8 | no speckle opening on the fused BEV obstacle grid | hours, offline | 1-2 cell IPM blobs become lethal cores with halos; the planner swerves around ghosts |
| P2 | segmentation caching — **done and measured** (`bc95360`) | — | 20.1% of segmentations skipped, no rate change; CPU saving (~3.5% of a core) is below what a live scene lets you measure |
| P9 | depth + confidence converted eagerly in the callbacks | hours | 3 cameras x 8 Hz of conversions the tick may never use |
| P10 | only ~29% of projections use depth, rest fall back to flat-ground IPM | measure first | wrong placement on slopes, and jitter as the two paths disagree; instrument the three reject gates before tuning |
| P5 | `line_bev.detect_bev` is 417 ms of a 452 ms tick | ~1 day + equivalence check | competition preset only (2.6 Hz); filed on the frame-cache branch |
| C8 | left/right ZED serials disagree between `sensors.launch.py` and the boot scripts | minutes, at the car | cover one camera, see which topic goes dark |

Also unjudged: `depth_stabilization: 0` in the lean profile has not been
assessed for depth quality.

Suggested order: P7 + P8 first (visible smoothing, no car needed), then finish
the P2 measurement, and schedule P6 before competition.
